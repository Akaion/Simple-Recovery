# Simple-Recovery
A Windows recovery tool written in C# that supports both saved Chrome and network passwords.

### How does it work?
By exploiting vulnerabilities in the security of the systems used to store the passwords, the passwords are able to be recovered in clear in text. Once this has been achieved, the passwords are written to text files and saved to a folder specified in App.Config. The default path is C:\Data

### Supported sources
* Google Chrome saved passwords
* Wireless networks that the computer has signed in to at some point

#### Please note I do not condone the useage of Simple Recovery for anything that may be considered illegal.
